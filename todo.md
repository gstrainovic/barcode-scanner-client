- Employee management. Employees must be able to be added and removed. A distinction must be made between production employees, shipping employees, customer service & admins.

- Employees must log in to the software with their access data when they start work. The access data is created by admins and handed out to the employees personally. Scanning of labels must not be possible until they have logged into the software.

- The scanned shipment numbers from the DHL labels must be stored in a database. The DHL labels always need the context of which employee scanned the DHL label at what time.

- Each employee must have the ability to search for shipment numbers in the software to see which employee produced the order and which employee packed and shipped the order.

- Possible generate reports in .pdf file format in monthly, weekly and user defined time periods, as an example more time periods like: "Today, Yesterday, Last Week, This Week, This Month, Last Month" are very interesting. Background for me as a manager is to know: Which employee has scanned how many and specifically which DHL labels. So I can internally analyze the performance of the employees. This function may only be available to admins (!!!).

- Customer service staff & admins must be able to flag shipment numbers as complaints in the software. If we receive complaints about an order via phone, or email, or a return, we must be able to mark this shipment number in the software with a defect/complaint and a note field - what exactly went wrong and for what reason did the customer complain. This field should be a free text field. Not a dropdown field.

- There should be another export option in that I can export the shipment numbers for each individual employee that is marked with a complaint. I use this document as a conversation starter for a staff meeting in private. A signature field for the employee with date of export should be automatically added at the end of the .pdf export. I will then file this document in the personnel file.


I look forward to receiving numerous applications and a long-term, successful collaboration.

The project is needed at the end of September.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Many greetings
